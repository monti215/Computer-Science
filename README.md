# CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Creating user stories is so important when considering the success of a program. These user stories address the desires of the user and what they want out
of the product. This is seen as one of the best ways to determine the direction of the project. We then take these user stories, address them in our daily/weekly scrum
meetings, assign values to each story, and development a plan on what items need to be looked at first. This helps the team stay on track and maintain focus 
on what is truly important to ensure the success of a project. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

By following the six phases of the SDLC, that is a great way to approach any development project. Following these phases of the SDLC, the scrum team knows exactly where
they are in a timeline and how to reach the next phase. One agile process I really like is the rapid development. THis is where you rapidly develop a product,
alweays making it better week after week. This is a great way to ensure time efficiecy and timely product development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member, in my eyes, is a good listener. Being able to listen and udnerstand what each team member suggests, or problems they are encountering, you are able
to learn and contribute meaningfuly within your team. Developing new skills and methods by seeing other peoples ways of doing things is also a great way to develop your
skills.
# CS300 - Analysis and Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For these two projects the first problem we were solving was a run-time and memory analysis for certain data structures. The second project's problem we were solving was to sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order, while also loading a data structure.


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures are important to understand because each structure serves different purposes. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
If course material did not give me teh answers I was looking for, consulting the internetr and seeing how other people with similar problems found a solution is a great way to learn more as a developer. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Learning the importance of run-time analysis and data structures was imperative in creating successful code.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project wanted to bring course materials, practice tests, and driving lessons to students that want to learn more and become a better driver. Liam, the owner of DriverPass sees this is a great opportunity to capatilize on because there is nothing like this out on the market yet. The type of system they want to design is a web-based application that will hold account info, payment information, as well as databases for study materials, and car availability and scheduling.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

I think creating the diagrams are essential in setting up any program. Understanding how it works before we start to work on the system will only make the project that much easier as we begint o work through it. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The PowerPoint presentation most likely. I was never a big fan of powerpoint presentations and would prefer to just put up images/design docs/charts/graphs/diagrams and then working through them with people instead of just reading a bulleted list of information. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By interpreting these needs we can pinpoint exactly what the client wants to see out of this project and how it will suceed in their eyes. It is always important to consider the user's needs because they will be the ones using it, and we want our system to do as intended to make both the user and the client happy. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Approaching designing software is pretty similar in how you would approach any project. First, we establish the needs of the client. Then, we crteate diagrams, charts etc. to get a better understanding of how the system will work to help us develop but to also create a timeline of when we thinik teh project will be done.
