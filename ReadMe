# CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Creating user stories is so important when considering the success of a program. These user stories address the desires of the user and what they want out
of the product. This is seen as one of the best ways to determine the direction of the project. We then take these user stories, address them in our daily/weekly scrum
meetings, assign values to each story, and development a plan on what items need to be looked at first. This helps the team stay on track and maintain focus 
on what is truly important to ensure the success of a project. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

By following the six phases of the SDLC, that is a great way to approach any development project. Following these phases of the SDLC, the scrum team knows exactly where
they are in a timeline and how to reach the next phase. One agile process I really like is the rapid development. THis is where you rapidly develop a product,
alweays making it better week after week. This is a great way to ensure time efficiecy and timely product development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member, in my eyes, is a good listener. Being able to listen and udnerstand what each team member suggests, or problems they are encountering, you are able
to learn and contribute meaningfuly within your team. Developing new skills and methods by seeing other peoples ways of doing things is also a great way to develop your
skills.
